### Step 2: Configure Authentication

When deploying the template, you’ll need to set up authentication for your Langtrace instance:

- Under the **Configuration** section, add the following environment variables:
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Your desired admin email
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Your desired admin password
- For additional authentication methods (e.g. Google OAuth, Azure AD), refer to our [Authentication](/hosting/auth) guide to configure the necessary environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Clickhouse service keeps restarting or crashing">
		This usually occurs when the Clickhouse service runs out of memory.
		You can increase the memory limit of the Clickhouse service from the **Resources** tab under its configuration.
	</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot access public URL">
		If the public URL doesn’t open, ensure the **langtrace-client** service has an **HTTP port (3000)** exposed and marked as **Public** under **Networking settings**.
	</Accordion>
